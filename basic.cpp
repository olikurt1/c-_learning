#include <iostream> //header file library allowing input and output with c++
using namespace std; //names for objects and variables can be used from standard library


int main(){ //function ot execute anything in the braces
    cout << "Hello World"; //C++ output of hell world
    cout << "I am learning C++"; //will output straight after d not on new line
    return 0;//ends main function 
}

//using namespace std can be avoided by adding std:: for required objects
// std::cout

// a statement is an instruction and each statement in c++ should end with ;
